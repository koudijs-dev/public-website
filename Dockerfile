# Serves the Hugo output. Two builds use it, both running `hugo` first to produce ./public:

#   publish-stuff.yml  -> prod-sha-<short>, the real baseURL, for koudijs.dev itself
# Pinned by digest so Dependabot proposes (and the routing test gates) base
# image bumps; the :alpine tag is kept for readability.
